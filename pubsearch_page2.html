  <H2>PubSearch Data and Dataflow</h2>
  <p><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Publications</span></b><span
style='font-family:Verdana'><br>
  <p>TAIR’s PubSearch installation presently contains 15,486 research articles, 
    book chapters, and reviews (7,782 full-text), and 1,204 abstracts from conference 
    proceedings. Most article information is obtained from (<a
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed" target="_blank">PubMed</a>, monthly 
    download) and the National Agronomics Library (NAL, quarterly download) that 
    compiles both <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/ag98/" target="_blank">Agricola</a> and <a
href="http://www.biosis.org/" target="_blank">BIOSIS</a>. The criteria for retrieving articles 
    is the occurrence of the word 'Arabidopsis’ in the title, abstract or keywords; 
    this query can easily be adapted for use with any other organism or purpose 
    of a database. The conference abstracts are usually obtained from the conference 
    organizers directly. Where possible, full text articles are downloaded in 
    portable document format (PDF) or scanned using optical character recognition 
    software <a href="http://www.scansoft.com/omnipage/" target="_blank">Omnipage 11</a> and converted 
    to PDF. About 20% of the articles in PDF were converted into plain text using 
    the pdftotext utility available on Unix platforms. These plain text representations 
    of articles are used in the full text search. </p>
  <b>Loci and genes </b>
  <p>The main source of gene information was obtained from the <a href="http://www.arabidopsis.org" target="_blank">TAIR database</a>
    Updates come mainly from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target="_blank"> Genbank</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.tigr.org" target="_blank">TIGR</a> and the user community. New genes are 
    also identified by PubSearch by scanning the literature using regular expressions 
    specific for <a href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/info/guidelines.html" target="_blank">gene 
    symbols</a>. Presently, there are 31,218 loci and 37,240 genes in the PubSearch 
    database. </p>
  <b>Keywords</b>
  <p>Keywords comprise approximately 
    14,238 <a href="http://www.geneontology.org" target="_blank">Gene Ontology</a> terms, and 400 
    terms from the <a href="http://www.arabidopssi.org/info/ontologies/" target="_blank"><a>TAIR ontologies</a> (developmental stages and anatomy 
    of Arabidopsis The GO terms are being updated in a local installation of the 
    GO database on a daily basis from the Gene Ontology CVS repository. The PubSearch 
    term table is then updated from the local GO database. </p>
