Peer-reviewed research articles remain the best medium for representing and disseminating 
the refinement of scientific knowledge. For any model organism database (MOD), 
the literature is one of the main data sources, and significant resources are 
devoted to capturing this information. This project is 
a collaboration between the <A href=http://www.arabidopsis.org target="_blank">Arabidopsis Information Resource, TAIR</a>
and the <a href="http://rgd.mcw.edu" target="_blank">Rat Genome Database, RGD,</a>

 two MODs with an emphasis on literature curation. Here, we propose to develop a literature 
curation tool that fulfills fundamental needs of a MOD in extracting information 
from the literature. 
<P>Three major components of this system are:
<UL>
<LI> importing articles 
from various literature databases; 
<LI>storing, screening, prioritizing, and curating 
articles; and
<LI>tracking of prioritized articles through the manual curation 
procedure. 
</UL>
<P>Our long-term goal is to develop a set of systematic procedures and 
tools for integrating knowledge from the confined context of a research article 
into the dynamic, broad context of a model organism database.  Both groups have 
developed different software components to facilitate in-house curation efforts 
and we propose to integrate these components to build a powerful, portable, and 
generic literature curation system. By building upon the existing developments 
undertaken at both sites and working together to achieve an integrated literature 
curation solution, we will maximize the utility and flexibility of the system 
we create. The system will be central to the curation efforts of the collaborating 
databases and will be useable as a whole or in parts by other existing or emerging 
MODs.
<p>Our proposed Specific Aims are as follows:<br>
<OL>
  <LI> Expand and enhance existing RGD modules to create a robust, extensible literature 
  database search and retrieval module, PubFetch. This will enable literature 
  retrieval from multiple literature databases using a consistent data exchange 
  format.<br>
  <LI> Extend and improve TAIR PubSearch tool to provide a robust, adaptable curation 
  module to store, search, annotate and prioritize articles for MOD curation. 
  This will use the PubFetch module as its literature data source, allow curators 
  to screen, prioritize, and curate information in the literature, and provide 
  output in a standard data format for MODs.<br>
  <LI>Create a literature tracking module, PubTrack, to track and report the status 
  of article curation by the MOD curation team. This will be designed to interface 
  with the PubSearch or an existing MOD literature database, and will be configurable 
  to reflect the curation process used by any individual MOD.<br><p>
